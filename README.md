# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
  
  The primary objective of this project is to delve deeper into the relationship between a player's value and their other performances within the FIFA 18 dataset. 

## Process 

1. Connecting Data
2. Data types
3. 5 different visualizations
4. The most important feature
5. Create the dashboard
6. challenges


## Results

I chose option number 2 because I will better understand what the data is talking about and I was always curious about the player value, so it was a great opportunity to find out some information related to that: 

#Viz1 : Nationalities that have a high number of Ball control:
  - Identification of the top nationalities known for players with high ball control like England and Spain. This could point to a focus on technical skills in those countries' football training programs.

#Viz2:  The correlation between age and balance, player  acceleration:                                                                                                - Younger players 16 to 30 are have higher acceleration and balance due to natural physical advantages of youth. 
  - As players age go up, acceleration might decline due to factors such as reduced muscle strength and slower reflexes.                                                          
#Viz3 : player's positioning rating correlates with their Reactions?
    - Depending on their positions , the correlation might be different. but as per the visual the correlation is diffrent based on the position rate .
    but Experienced players, regardless of their physical reaction times, may show high positioning ratings due to their understanding of the game and anticipatory skills, suggesting a possible moderating effect of experience on the correlation.

#Viz4 : How do player values vary across different countries?
    - Brazil and Argentina produce higher-value players due to their superior football infrastructure, training programs, and a culture that fosters talent from a young age.
    - Player values might also reflect the economic realities of their home countries. For instance, players from countries with strong economies and high-income levels might have higher market values.
    - 
#Viz5 : Are there any trends in player 'Value' over 'Overall' rating
   - the graph shows that Lower-rated players might have higher values due to perceived potential rather than current performance. maybe theres is Data anomalies also.

#The most important feature:
Value of players is the most important feature : This determines the worth of the player in which can be influenced by several factors such as age, play skills lie balance , ball control, and performance.

## Challenges 
One of the challenges faced during this analysis was the limitation of my laptop's processing capacity. With a large dataset like FIFA 18, Tableau got freezed many times also.


## Future Goals
In the future, my goal is to further refine my skills in creating effective and insightful dashboards,I plan to learn more about best practices for dashboard design, as well as exploring advanced features of Tableau to maximize the value I can deliver through my visualizations.
